  <blockquote>
    This section explains how to get GitBruh up and running.
  </blockquote>

  <h3 id="Add-GitBruh-to-Slack">Install GitBruh</h3>
  <p>
    Click on the button <i>Add to Slack</i> in the homepage. You will be redirected to Slack
    authorization page. Choose the team to which you want to add GitBruh. Then, you will be redirected
    to GitHub authorization page.
  </p>

  <p>
    If everything went well, you will receive a welcome message with information on
    getting more familiar with GitBruh.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h3 id="Watch-repos">Watch a GitHub repository</h3>
  <p>
    To start receiving messages for a given repository, you first need to tell GitBruh. Use the
    <a href="{{site.github.url}}/#Slack-commands">Slack command</a> <code>/watchrepos username/repo-name</code>. Make sure you are
    on the team on which you added GitBruh.

    A new GitHub webhook pointing to GitBruh is added to the repository you supplied. Learn
    more about <a href="{{site.github.url}}/#watchrepos"><code>/watchrepos</code></a>.
  </p>

  </br>
  <p>
    <strong>And that's it !</strong> You should start receiving <a
      href="{{site.github.url}}/#GitHub-activity-messages">GitHub activity messages</a>
    related to the newly watched repo from <strong>gitbruh</strong> Slack bot.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="Slack-commands" class="page-header">Slack commands</h1>

  <blockquote>
    GitBruh comes with a set of <a href="https://api.slack.com/slash-commands"
      target="_blank"> slack commands </a>
    to interact with users. These commands can be executed from any channel of
    a team where GitBruh is installed. All these commands are described in this section.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong>
    Don't forget to prepend a slash "/" before the command name.
  </div>

  <h3 id="watchrepos">/watchrepos</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Example</strong> : <code>/watchrepos john/awesome-stuff john/another-stuff</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Watch GitHub repositories by GitBruh.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can specify one or multiple repos separated by a whitespace. When a repository is
    successfully watched by a user, he will start receiving messages related to this repo. A repo can be unwatched by issuing
    <a href="{{site.github.url}}/#unwatchrepos"><code>/unwatchrepos</code></a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under the hood, two things are happening here (for each repo):
    <li>GitBruh registers the repo as being watched by you.</li>
    <li>GitBruh adds a GitHub webhook to the repo.</li>
    <br/>
    <p>
      To receive messages related to the repo, the steps above <strong>must</strong> be
      successful. If not, the response from <code>/watchrepos</code> will contain additional
      information on further actions to take to properly set up the repo.
    </p>
    <h5>Response</h5>
    <p>
      The response contains at most three sections :
    </p>
    <li>
      <span style="color:green;">Green</span> : The repos listed in this section have been successfully watched by
      GitBruh and a webhook is set on each repo (previous steps succeded both).
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color:orange;">Orange</span> : The repos listed has been registered by GitBruh as being watched by you
      (step 1 succeeded) but the webhook couldn't be added because you don't have enough
      permissions. The webhook has to be added by an owner by issuing <a href="{{site.github.url}}/#watchrepos"><code>/watchrepos</code></a>
      or <a href="{{site.github.url}}/#Add-webhook-manually">manually</a>. After adding
      the webhook, you don't need to re-issue <a href="{{site.github.url}}/#watchrepos"><code>/watchrepos</code></a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color:red;">Red</span> : GitBruh couldn't watch the repos or add a
      webhook because it couldn't find them (both steps failed). This usually means that
      you mistyped the repo name or you didn't authorize GitBruh to <a
        href="https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-organization-approval-for-oauth-apps/"
        target="_blank">access organization
        repos</a>. After granting access, you will need to re-issue <a href="{{site.github.url}}/#watchrepos"><code>/watchrepos</code></a>.
    </li>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    When no repos are supplied to the command, GitBruh will send an error message specifying
    the error details.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h3 id="unwatchrepos">/unwatchrepos</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Example</strong> : <code>/unwatchrepos john/awesome-stuff john/another-stuff</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Stop watching GitHub repositories by GitBruh.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can specify one or multiple repos separated by a whitespace. When a repository is
    unwatched, the user will stop receiving messages related to this repo. After issuing this
    command, GitBruh will respond with a message with at most two sections(defined by the
    outcomes below). Each section regroups the repos that meet its description. To watch again
    <a href="{{site.github.url}}/#watchrepos"><code>/watchrepos</code></a>.
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong>  Webhooks must be deleted
      manually. Webhooks associated with unwatched repos are not deleted automatically
      because other users may still be watching these repos. Make sure it is not the case
      before deleting any webhook.</div>
  </p>

  <h5>Response</h5>
  <p>
    After issuing <code>/unwatchrepos</code>, GitBruh will respond with a messages containing
    at most two sections :
    <li><span style="color:green;">Green</span> : The repo has been unwatched. You will no longer receive messages related to
      it.</li>
    <li><span style="color:red;">Red</span> : The repo has not been found. This usually means
    it is a mistyping error or that the repo is not currently being watched by you.</li>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    When no repos are supplied to the command, GitBruh will send an error message specifying
    the error details.

  <h3 id="Message-interactions">Message interactions</h3>
  <p>
    GitBruh leverages a cool feature of Slack API called <a
      href="https://api.slack.com/interactive-messages" target="_blank"> interactive messages</a>.
    Broadly, it allows a user to trigger one or multiple actions after receiving a Slack message
    containing elements for interacting with it (buttons, menus). GitBruh uses this API
    to allow users to interact with GitBruh messages in Slack by muting/unmuting issues or pull
    requests, or snoozing messages.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Message-interactions-mute">Mute</h4>
  <p>
    By clicking on the <i>Mute Issue</i> button, the user won't receive any
    further messages related to the issue. Clicking again will unmute the issue.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Message-interactions-unmute">Unmute</h4>
  <p>
    By clicking on the <i>Unmute</i> button, the user will again receive messages related to
    the issue. Clicking again will mute the issue.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Message-interactions-snooze">Snooze</h4>
  <p>
    A user can snooze a message to be able to act upon it at a more convenient moment. By
    clicking on the <i>Snooze...</i> button, a menu will show with two options (1 hour or
    tomorrow). The message will then be delivered at the chosen moment.
  </p>
  <img src="assets/images/message_interactions_snooze.png" width="60%"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong>
    The snoozed version of the message received contains the time at which the original
    message has been sent.
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong>
    The snoozed version of the message received doesn't have a mute button. You can only
    mute from the original message. It is so to keep consistency with the muting status of
    the issue shown on the button (<i>Mute Issue</i> = issue not muted / <i>Unmute</i> = issue muted),
    as it would be required to update the <i>Mute</i>/<i>Unmute</i> buttons of all snoozed versions to
    reflect the status of the issue.
  </div>
</section>
<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="webhook-configuration" class="page-header">Webhook configuration</h1>
  <blockquote>
    To be able to receive events from GitHub for a specific repo, GitBruh needs a webhook
    to be set up on the repo. Once the webhook set, GitBruh will start receiving events from
    GitHub for a specific set of actions undertaken by any collaborator on the repository.
